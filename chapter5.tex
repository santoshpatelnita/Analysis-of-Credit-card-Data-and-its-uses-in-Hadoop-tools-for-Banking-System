\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\subsection{Conclusion}
Bank are creating large amount of data day by day. Their creation speed is much faster than our processor's speed.So the handling of bulk amount of data is difficult for our system. But storing and processing of Big Data is faster when it stored in distributed manner. Hadoop framework provides such king of network where Big Data distributed among different system.By adding more nodes.Data can be store in different in different location.If any nodes fails then there is no loss of data.By the use of big data banks run more profitably. To make money, banks use deposits and whole sale deposits, share equity and fees and interest from debt, loans and consumer lending, such as credit cards and bank fees. History has proven banks to be vulnerable to many risks, however, including credit, liquidity, market, operating, interesting rate and legal risks.\newpage
\subsection{Future Work}
Hardware and Software can be minimize so that user base can increase.\newline
Working process can reduced so that efficiency and performance of the application can improve.\newline
To ensure that data analytics future is great in India, normal development & use of big data subsequently must be supported to boost scope of Data Analytics. Banks use data mining methods to filter the populated data.
