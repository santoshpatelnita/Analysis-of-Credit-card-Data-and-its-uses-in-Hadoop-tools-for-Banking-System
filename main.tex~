\prefacesection{Acknowledgment}

I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep sense of gratitude to all who helped me directly or indirectly
 during this thesis work.\\

Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, \textbf{Prof. Supervisor Name}, for being a great mentor and the best adviser 
I could ever have. Her advise, encouragement and critics are source of innovative ideas, inspiration and causes behind the successful
completion of this dissertation. The confidence shown on me  by her was the biggest source of inspiration 
for me. It has been a privilege working with her from last one year.\\

I am highly obliged to all the faculty members of Computer Science and Engineering Department for their support and encouragement. 
I also thank our Director \textbf{Prof.~Probir~Kr.~Bose} and H.O.D, CSED \textbf {Prof. HOD Name }
for providing excellent computing and other facilities without which this work could not achieve its quality goal.
\\
 
I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude towards 
\textbf{Prof.~Anupam~Jamatia \& Prof.~Mrinal~Kanti~Debbarma } for their 
support to prepare the thesis report in \LaTeX.\\

 Finally, I am grateful to my \textbf{parents} for their support. It was impossible for me to complete 
this thesis work without their love, blessing  and
encouragement.
\\

\subsection*{\textbf{M.Tech Thesis Research Orientation}} 
IEEE LTSA framework has been able to genrate interest for implementation of e-Learning technology meant for two-tier or three tier.
 Such e-Learning framework lacks security aspect making it insufficient for web educational services through Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Implementation of different security services at different
layers requires a pragmatic mapping from client-server architecture to distributed system architecture and finally to Service Oriented Architecture.
